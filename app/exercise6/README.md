# Exercise 6
**Scenario:**
You're working on a feature that allows a user to update their profile information. The update logic is handled by a function called `updateProfile(data)`. This function makes an API call to a backend service.

**Task:**
1. Using a testing framework like **Jest** or **Playwright**, write a **test** for the `updateProfile` function.
2. Show how you would **assert that the function behaves correctly** in both scenarios (e.g., that it returns the expected data on success or throws an error on failure).
3. Briefly explain the difference between a unit test and an end-to-end test and when you would use each.
