# Exercise 3 
**Scenario:**  
You're asked to manage the state of a **shopping cart** in a small e-commerce app. Requirements:  
- Add/remove products.  
- Persist cart between page reloads.  
- Allow multiple tabs to stay in sync.  

**Task:**  
- Propose a **state management approach** (e.g., localStorage, custom store, IndexedDB).  
- Implement a minimal TypeScript example of how adding/removing products would work.
