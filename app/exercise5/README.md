# Exercise 5

**Scenario:**
You need to display a list of financial transactions that have a `date` and a `total` amount. The application is used globally.

**Task:**

1.  Write a function that takes a transaction date (as a string) and a user's `timezone` string (e.g., `'Europe/Madrid'`) and **formats the date** for display.
2.  Write a second function that takes a total amount and a `currency` code (e.g., `'EUR'`) and **formats it using the correct currency symbol and locale**.
3.  Ensure that you are always seeing the correct timezone and currency independently of where you are loading your data
