# Exercise 10
**Scenario:**
A B2B dashboard displays a large, complex table of data. A user reports that they are having trouble finding the data they need, and the UI feels overwhelming.

**Task:**
1. Given this scenario, describe your **process for addressing this user feedback**. What questions would you ask the user or the product manager?
2. Propose **three concrete, UI/UX-focused solutions** to improve the user's experience. Explain the **tradeoffs** of each solution (e.g., development effort, performance impact, user learning curve).
3. If you had to choose just one solution to implement in the next sprint, which would you pick and why?
