# Exercise 9

**Scenario:**
You are working on an internal tool where different users have different levels of access.

**Task:**

1.  Assume a user object with a `role` property (e.g., `'admin'`, `'editor'`, `'viewer'`).
2.  Write a function that handles the users permissions and accesses to sections of your app
3.  Provide an example of how you would **conditionally render a "Delete" button** in the UI based on this function.
